Instead of searching the internet for information you forgot about,
search a personalized database that knows everything you ever learned.
We spend so much time looking for information about a topic that resonates
with us that it would be a good idea to store this information somewhere
we can search for if we ever need to refresh our memories.

The idea is similar to taking notes, but the problem with notes is that they can get
long and information can be harder to find. Additionally, related information may be
scattered. With search_me, if you have an idea you want more information about,
you query the database and intelligent systems will attempt to return relevant
information in an organized way.

Version 1:
Simple search based on initial label.

How to use:
Clone the repository in a local directory
cd into the directory
Type "sh e.sh 0"
This uses your DB from a previous session and lets you add to it.

"sh e.sh 1" wipes any saved DB and starts with a clean one.
Only used for testing.
